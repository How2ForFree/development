<p>This document is strictly for people who are trying to upgrade this theme from a previous version. It will discuss the file changes as well as any notes that are important for updating. </p>

<p>Please take the time to create a backup of your previous version of this theme in case something goes wrong. I do my best to make updating as smooth as possible, but it's always best to be safe!</p>

<p>As always, updating is as easy as just over-writing your existing theme-folder with the newest version... but this log helps people who have made customizations to upload JUST the new files. If you haven't messed with the core template files, chances are that all you need to do is upload the new theme folder (keep a backup of your old one!). This won't change your content (images, pages, posts, etc.) at all.</p>

<legend>Version 2.0.X</legend>

<p>
Version 2.0.X is part of a much larger update of all of my themes (by Brandon R Jones, aka Epicera at ThemeForest). All themes have been moved into a new naming convention, where "2.0" represents the framework version, and the trailing ".X" represents the actual version number of the individual theme. This is part of a larger effort to universalize the theme framework. The major updates are inside the /functions folder, but nearly all of the files in the theme have been editted in accordance with the new framework system. This shouldn't affect your content or anything, so update your theme as you normally would:

<ol>
	<li>Create a backup of your current theme folder inside /wp-content/themes.</li>
	<li>Update/overwrite the new folder via FTP.</li>
	<li>Clear your browser cache and test the theme out.</li>
	<li>Report any bugs to the support forum > http://support.makedesignnotwar.com</li>
</ol> 

Thanks for the continued support and feedback everyone!

<legend>Version 1.4</legend>

<p>The Version 1.4 update brings several <b>major</b> changes to the entire theme, and it's highly recommended that you keep a backup of your existing theme folder just in case. I've done my best to make this update process as easy as possible for anyone who has </p> 

<p><b>New Files</b></p>

<ul>
<li>css/core.css (Updated "page_item" to reflect the new "menu-item" class in WP3.0X)</li>
<li>header.php</li>
<li>functions/menu.php</li>
<li>functions/theme-panel.php</li>
</ul>


<p>1) New WP 3.0 Menus are Supported!!! The main note here is that you'll need to now use the Appearance > Menus page in the admin panel. You'll notice the removal of the "Home Link" and "Categories Dropdown" options from the Los Angeles admin page because you can now add these directly. Sweet!</p>
